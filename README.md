# Front-End-UA92
This web application project was conducted on behalf of our client, TNK technologies t/a 3dworks.
Following extensive elicitation techniques to derive functional requirements of the Web Application,
graphic design of the website commenced. This included a draft sketch of the Website using basic 
wireframe diagrams and Canva for illustrative purposes.

An e-commerce website was therefore developed in 4 stages:
1. Prototype 1: Basic HTML and CSS
2. Prototype 2: Incorporation of the Bootsrap Web Framework
3. Prototype 3: Javascript incorporated
4. Beta and final version for presentation: Business and legal pages; improved styling.

The design team agreed a reasonable time frame with the client of 6 weeks to design a Beta Version 
of the Web Application. A presentation of the project was scheduled for 26/10/2023 at the clientâ€™s 
headquarters, UA92, Old Trafford Manchester.
